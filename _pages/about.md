I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT)**.  
My research focuses on **learning-enabled resilient autonomy** for safety-critical cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on fault-tolerant control, adaptive observers, and robustness under actuator, sensor, and perception faults.

My work integrates **nonlinear control theory** (contraction theory, Lyapunov methods, adaptive control), **learning and optimization with guarantees** (mirror descent, adaptive neural networks), and **causal reasoning** to enable provably safe autonomy for spacecraft and multi-agent robotic systems.

I am particularly interested in developing principled frameworks that bridge classical control and machine learning to enable reliable fault detection, identification, and recovery (FDIR) with formal guarantees of stability and performance. My research is validated through high-fidelity simulation and experimental testbeds in aerospace and robotics.
