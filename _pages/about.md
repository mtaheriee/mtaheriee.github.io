I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories of the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT). My research focuses on **learning-enabled resilient autonomy** for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS), with emphasis on fault-tolerant control, cyberattack detection, and robustness under actuator, sensor, and perception faults as well as adversarial cyberattacks.

My work integrates **nonlinear control theory**, **online learning** with formal guarantees, and **causal inference** to enable provably safe autonomy for autonomous systems. I am particularly interested in developing principled frameworks that bridge classical control theory and machine learning to enable reliable cyberattack and fault detection, identification, and recovery (FDIR) with formal guarantees of stability and performance. My research is validated through high-fidelity simulation and experimental testbeds in aerospace and robotics.
