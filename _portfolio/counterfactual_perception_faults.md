### Overview
Perception systems are critical for autonomous spacecraft and space robots performing rendezvous, proximity operations, and planetary exploration.

### Key Idea
In this work, we integrated **structural causal models (SCMs)** and **counterfactual reasoning** into closed-loop autonomy to diagnose perception faults.

### Key Contributions
- Used **counterfactual queries** to test perceptual reliability
- Quantified **Effective Information (EI)** as a measure of causal informativeness
- Formulated **active fault diagnosis** as a causal bandit problem
- Solved the resulting problem using **Monte Carlo Tree Search**

### Case Study
Autonomous spacecraft proximity operations for asteroid exploration using perception-based navigation.

This represents the **first integration of counterfactual reasoning with perception fault isolation** in an autonomous closed-loop system.
