### Overview
During my Ph.D. studies, I investigated **stealthy deception cyber-attacks** in cyber-physical systems (CPS), including power systems, aircraft, and multi-spacecraft systems. These attacks exploit system dynamics to **evade conventional residual-based and observer-based detection methods**.

### Key Contributions
- Derived **theoretical conditions** under which cyber-attacks remain undetectable in linear and nonlinear dynamical systems
- Identified fundamental limitations of existing monitoring architectures
- Developed **dynamic coding scheme–based defenses** that prevent:
  - zero-dynamics attacks  
  - controllable attacks  
  - covert attacks  

### Impact
The proposed defenses guarantee attack detectability **without requiring attack models**, and have been validated on aerospace and networked control systems.  
These contributions are published in leading control journals and conferences.
